# OMEGA-4: Progressive Migration Approach

## Overview
OMEGA-4 is a careful, progressive migration of the OMEGA-2 audio analyzer from a monolithic script to a modular architecture. Unlike the failed OMEGA-3 attempt which tried to modularize everything at once, OMEGA-4 takes a gradual approach.

## Key Principles
1. **Keep it Working**: Every change must maintain full functionality
2. **Small Steps**: Extract one module at a time
3. **Test Continuously**: Verify after each change
4. **No Premature Optimization**: Don't refactor until extraction is complete

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Configuration ✓ COMPLETE
- Extracted all constants to `omega4/config.py`
- Main file imports configuration
- Zero functionality changes

### Phase 2: Display Layer (PLANNED)
- Extract ONLY rendering code
- Keep all processing in main
- Create simple display interface

### Phase 3: Individual Analyzers (FUTURE)
- Extract one analyzer at a time
- Start with simplest (e.g., DrumDetector)
- Test thoroughly before next

### Phase 4: Audio Engine (FUTURE)
- Extract audio capture
- Extract FFT processing
- Keep interface simple

### Phase 5: Integration & Optimization (FUTURE)
- Only after all modules work
- Performance optimization
- Code cleanup

## Current Status
- Phase 1: ✓ Complete
- Phase 2: Planning stage
- Original functionality: 100% preserved

## Running OMEGA-4
```bash
python3 run_omega4.py --bars 1024
```

## Testing
```bash
python3 test_omega4.py
```

## Why This Approach?
The OMEGA-3 attempt failed because:
- Too many changes at once
- Lost track of data flow
- Introduced subtle bugs
- Over-engineered the architecture

OMEGA-4 succeeds by:
- Changing one thing at a time
- Maintaining working state
- Testing after each change
- Keeping interfaces simple
