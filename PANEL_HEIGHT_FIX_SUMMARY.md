# Panel Height and Grid Positioning Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Panel Height Increased
- **Problem**: Professional Meters panel text was overlapping with panels below
  - "Attack" text was at the bottom edge (220px) 
  - "Punch" text was rendered outside panel boundaries (240px)
- **Solution**: Increased panel height from 220px to 260px
  - This provides 40px of additional vertical space
  - All text now fits comfortably within panel boundaries

### 2. Grid Positioning Fixed
- **Problem**: Room analysis panel was being drawn separately, causing potential overlaps
- **Solution**: Integrated room analysis panel into the main grid system
  - Room panel is now part of the `active_panels` list
  - It gets assigned a proper grid position like all other panels
  - Prevents any overlap with other panels

## Changes Made

### In omega4_main.py:

1. **Panel height updates** (lines 1728, 1897):
   ```python
   panel_height = 260  # Increased from 220 to accommodate all text
   ```

2. **Grid system integration** (lines 1966-1967):
   ```python
   if self.show_room_analysis:
       active_panels.append(('room', None))  # Special case - drawn manually
   ```

3. **Room panel drawing** (lines 2006-2035):
   - Moved room panel drawing into the main panel loop
   - Now handles room panel as a special case within the grid system
   - Draws up to 8 room modes (increased from 6) to utilize the extra height

4. **Frozen state support** (lines 2054-2055):
   - Added room panel to frozen state checks
   - Ensures consistent behavior with other panels

5. **Removed duplicate code** (lines 2069-2125):
   - Removed the old room analysis drawing code that was outside the main loop
   - This prevents double-drawing and positioning conflicts

## Benefits

1. **No more text overlap**: All panel text now fits within boundaries
2. **Consistent grid layout**: All panels follow the same positioning rules
3. **Better space utilization**: 260px height allows for more content
4. **Cleaner code**: Single drawing loop for all panels
5. **Future-proof**: Easy to add new panels without positioning conflicts

## Panel Layout

The grid system now properly handles all panels:
- Maximum 4 panels per row
- Each panel is 260px tall with 10px padding
- Panels are added in order: Meters → Harmonic → Pitch → Chromagram → Genre → Room → Integrated
- Grid automatically wraps to next row after 4 panels
