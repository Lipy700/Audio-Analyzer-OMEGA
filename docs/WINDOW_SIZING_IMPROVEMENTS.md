# Window Sizing Improvements Summary

## Problem
The window presets (keys 1-9) had fixed dimensions that were too small to accommodate the panels, causing layout issues when panels were displayed.

## Height Requirements Analysis

### Component Heights:
- Header: 120px
- Spectrum: 800px
- Spectrum margins: 110px (top: 10, bottom: 100)
- Panel offset: 40px
- Footer: 80px
- **Base minimum: 1150px** (no panels)

### Panel Heights:
- Bass zoom panel: 260px + 10px padding
- Technical panels: 260px each + 10px padding
- Integrated panel: 310px (260 + 50 extra)

### Total Heights by Configuration:
- **No panels**: 1150px minimum
- **With bass zoom only**: 1420px
- **Bass + 1 row panels** (1-4 panels): 1690px
- **Bass + 2 rows panels** (5-8 panels): 1950px
- **With integrated panel**: Add 50px

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Window Presets (Keys 1-9)

| Key | Width  | Height | Description |
|-----|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1   | 1280   | 1150   | Minimum (no panels) |
| 2   | 1400   | 1420   | With bass zoom |
| 3   | 1600   | 1420   | HD+ width with bass |
| 4   | 1920   | 1420   | Full HD width with bass |
| 5   | 1920   | 1690   | Full HD with 1 row panels |
| 6   | 2560   | 1690   | QHD width with 1 row |
| 7   | 2560   | 1950   | QHD with 2 rows panels |
| 8   | 3440   | 1950   | Ultra-wide with 2 rows |
| 9   | 3840   | 2160   | 4K UHD (full panels) |

### 2. Dynamic Height Adjustment
- Presets now calculate the actual required height based on active panels
- Uses the larger of preset height or calculated requirement
- Ensures panels always fit properly

### 3. Minimum Size Enforcement
- Constructor enforces minimum width: 1280px
- Constructor enforces minimum height: 1150px
- Warning displayed if requested size is too small

### 4. Updated Help Text
- Shortened key descriptions to fit on screen
- Added preset descriptions: "1:Min 2-4:Bass 5-7:Panels 8-9:Full"
- Clearer indication of what each preset provides

## Benefits

1. **No More Clipping**: All presets guarantee sufficient height for their intended use
2. **Progressive Sizing**: Presets gradually increase to accommodate more panels
3. **Smart Adjustment**: Presets adapt to actual panel configuration
4. **Clear Expectations**: Users know what each preset number provides
5. **Minimum Safety**: Application prevents windows too small to be usable

## Usage

- **Keys 1-3**: Basic layouts for spectrum analysis only
- **Keys 4-5**: Include bass zoom and some technical panels
- **Keys 6-7**: Professional layouts with multiple analysis panels
- **Keys 8-9**: Full studio configurations with all panels visible

The system now ensures that regardless of which preset is chosen, all active panels will be properly displayed without overlap or clipping.
