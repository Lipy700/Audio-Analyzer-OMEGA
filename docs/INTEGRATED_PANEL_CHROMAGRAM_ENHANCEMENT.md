# Integrated Panel Chromagram Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Panel Position
- Moved integrated panel to **column 2** (under Pitch Detection)
- Changed from `col = 1` to `col = 2` in omega4_main.py

### 2. Chromagram Border
Added a framed border around the entire chromagram display:
- Dark background (25, 25, 35) with padding
- Border color (80, 80, 100) with 2px width
- Border encompasses both the bars and note labels
- Total bordered area is `height + 20px` to include labels

### 3. Color-Coded Chromagram
Implemented a rainbow color scheme for the 12 notes:
- C = Red (255, 100, 100)
- C# = Red-Orange (255, 150, 100)
- D = Orange (255, 200, 100)
- D# = Yellow (255, 255, 100)
- E = Yellow-Green (200, 255, 100)
- F = Green (100, 255, 100)
- F# = Green-Cyan (100, 255, 200)
- G = Cyan (100, 200, 255)
- G# = Cyan-Blue (100, 150, 255)
- A = Blue (100, 100, 255)
- A# = Blue-Purple (150, 100, 255)
- B = Purple (200, 100, 255)

### 4. Improved Visibility
- Added **1.5x scaling factor** to amplify chromagram values
- Reduced chromagram height from 60px to 50px for better proportions
- Bar heights use 90% of available space for visual margin
- Added brightness adjustment based on value (0.5 to 1.0 range)

### 5. Enhanced Note Labels
- Added background rectangles behind each note label
  - Darker background for sharps (40, 40, 50)
  - Lighter background for naturals (50, 50, 60)
- Improved label contrast
  - Brighter text for naturals (220, 220, 240)
  - Slightly dimmer for sharps (180, 180, 200)

### 6. Visual Separators
- Added thin vertical lines between each note (50, 50, 60)
- Helps distinguish between adjacent notes

## Final Layout

```
Row 0: [Meters] [Harmonic] [Pitch] [Room]
Row 1: [      ] [        ] [Integrated] [    ]
                          ^-- Column 2
```

## Visual Improvements

The chromagram now features:
1. **Better visibility** - 1.5x scaling makes even small values visible
2. **Clear note identification** - Color coding helps identify notes at a glance
3. **Professional appearance** - Border and backgrounds create a polished look
4. **Musical intuition** - Rainbow spectrum follows the chromatic scale
5. **Improved readability** - Note labels have better contrast with backgrounds

## Technical Details

- The `scale_factor` of 1.5 amplifies small values while clamping at 1.0
- Brightness adjustment ensures colors remain visible even for low values
- The bordered area automatically adjusts with UI scaling
- Separator lines help when multiple adjacent notes are active
