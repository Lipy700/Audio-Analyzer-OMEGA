# OMEGA-4 Panel Improvement Plan

## Current Issues to Address

### 1. Voice Detection Panel (Currently Hidden)
- Not visible by default (`self.show_voice_detection = False`)
- Needs integration with the main display
- Should show formant analysis when active

### 2. Phase Analysis Panel (Currently Hidden)
- Not visible by default (`self.show_phase = False`)
- Important for stereo content analysis
- Should display phase correlation

### 3. Transient Detection Panel (Currently Hidden)
- Not visible by default (`self.show_transient = False`)
- Useful for drum and percussion analysis
- Should visualize attack characteristics

### 4. Performance Optimizations Needed
- Some panels update too frequently
- Need adaptive update rates based on content
- Memory allocation improvements

## Proposed Improvements

### Phase 1: Activate Hidden Panels
1. **Voice Detection Panel**
   - Create visual panel for voice activity
   - Show formant frequencies
   - Display voice confidence meter
   - Add pitch tracking for vocals

2. **Phase Correlation Panel**
   - Stereo width visualization
   - Phase correlation meter (-1 to +1)
   - Frequency-dependent phase display
   - Mono compatibility warnings

3. **Transient Analysis Panel**
   - Attack/decay visualization
   - Transient density graph
   - Drum hit indicators
   - Dynamic range display

### Phase 2: Enhance Existing Panels
1. **Integrated Music Panel**
   - Add tempo detection
   - Improve genre classification accuracy
   - Add mood/energy analysis
   - Show song structure (verse/chorus detection)

2. **Bass Zoom Panel**
   - Add sub-bass analyzer (20-60Hz)
   - Show bass note detection
   - Add kick drum pattern visualization
   - Frequency-specific compression detection

3. **Room Analysis Panel**
   - Add frequency response graph
   - Show problematic frequencies
   - Add treatment suggestions
   - Visualize standing waves

### Phase 3: Add New Advanced Panels
1. **Dynamics Panel**
   - Compression ratio detection
   - Gate activity
   - Limiter engagement
   - Dynamic range history

2. **Spectrum History Panel**
   - Waterfall/spectrogram view
   - Adjustable time window
   - Frequency tracking over time
   - Event markers

3. **Mix Analysis Panel**
   - Frequency masking detection
   - Instrument separation clarity
   - Tonal balance meter
   - Mix suggestions

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Today)
1. Enable and fix voice detection panel
2. Enable and implement phase correlation panel
3. Enable and enhance transient detection panel
4. Fix any layout issues with new panels

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Enhance integrated music panel with tempo detection
2. Improve bass zoom panel with sub-bass analysis
3. Add dynamics visualization to professional meters

### Long Term (Future)
1. Implement spectrum history/waterfall view
2. Add AI-powered mix analysis
3. Create plugin integration framework

## Technical Considerations

1. **Layout Management**
   - May need to adjust window minimum height
   - Consider tabbed interface for numerous panels
   - Implement panel priority system

2. **Performance**
   - Use adaptive update rates
   - Implement panel-specific frame skipping
   - Cache expensive calculations

3. **User Experience**
   - Add panel descriptions/tooltips
   - Implement panel presets
   - Allow custom panel arrangements

## Success Metrics

1. All panels visible and functional
2. No performance degradation with all panels active
3. Clear, informative visualizations
4. Responsive to user input
5. Professional appearance
