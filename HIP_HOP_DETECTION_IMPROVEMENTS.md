# Hip-Hop Genre Detection Improvements

## Problem
The genre classification system was not effectively detecting hip-hop music despite its distinctive characteristics like strong beats and rhythmic vocals.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Adjusted Core Parameters
Updated the hip-hop genre profile with more accurate ranges:

- **Tempo range**: Expanded from (70-100) to (60-110) BPM to cover trap, boom bap, and other sub-genres
- **Spectral centroid**: Lowered from (1500-3000) to (800-2500) Hz to reflect bass emphasis
- **Zero crossing rate**: Widened from (0.05-0.15) to (0.04-0.20) to accommodate vocal variety
- **Spectral rolloff**: Adjusted from (2500-4500) to (2000-5000) Hz for bass-heavy mixes
- **Dynamic range**: Increased from (0.3-0.6) to (0.4-0.8) for punchy drums
- **Percussion strength**: Tightened from (0.8-1.0) to (0.85-1.0) for very strong beats

### 2. Added Hip-Hop Specific Features

Three new features that are characteristic of hip-hop:

#### Bass Emphasis (0.7-1.0)
- Measures how much bass (20-250Hz) dominates the spectrum
- Calculates bass-to-mid ratio to detect the characteristic heavy bass
- Hip-hop typically has 2x more bass energy than mid frequencies

#### Beat Regularity (0.8-1.0)
- Detects consistent, strong beat patterns
- Uses kick and snare detection to measure regularity
- Hip-hop has very regular 4/4 patterns with strong kick/snare

#### Vocal Presence (0.6-1.0)
- Detects prominent vocals in the 200-4000Hz range
- Focuses on core vocal range (300-3000Hz) where rap vocals sit
- Hip-hop typically has vocals as the main element

### 3. Enhanced Classification Logic

- Added specialized scoring for hip-hop features with higher weights:
  - Bass emphasis: 1.2 weight (highest priority)
  - Beat regularity: 1.0 weight
  - Vocal presence: 0.8 weight
  
- These weights ensure that bass-heavy, beat-driven music with prominent vocals scores highly for hip-hop

### 4. Improved Drum Info Structure

- Fixed drum info extraction to provide proper structure
- Ensures kick and snare detection data is always available
- Better supports beat regularity calculation

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods Added to GenreClassifier:

```python
compute_bass_emphasis(fft_data, freqs) -> float
# Calculates bass dominance in the spectrum

compute_beat_regularity(drum_info) -> float  
# Measures beat consistency using drum detection

compute_vocal_presence(fft_data, freqs) -> float
# Detects vocal energy in typical frequency ranges
```

## Expected Results

With these improvements, hip-hop detection should be significantly more accurate:

1. **Trap music**: Strong 808 bass will trigger high bass emphasis
2. **Boom bap**: Regular kick/snare patterns will score high on beat regularity
3. **Contemporary hip-hop**: Prominent vocals will be properly detected
4. **Sub-bass heavy tracks**: Lower spectral centroid range will match better

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the improvements:
1. Test with various hip-hop sub-genres (trap, boom bap, drill, etc.)
2. Compare detection rates before/after for hip-hop vs other genres
3. Monitor the new feature values in the debug output
4. Ensure other genres aren't misclassified as hip-hop

The system should now reliably detect hip-hop's signature elements: heavy bass, strong regular beats, and prominent vocals/rap.
